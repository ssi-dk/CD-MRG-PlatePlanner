# This configuration file is used to define the distribution of Quality Control (QC) and specimen samples
# within a multiwell plate. The file is structured into several sections, each responsible for different
# aspects of the plate layout.

[QC]
# These config parameters determine how QC samples are distributed on the plate. 

# QC round = a sequence of QC samples included before and/or 
#           after a sequence of analytical (specimen) samples

# should first well(s) be a QC round?
start_with_QC_round = true
# how many non-QC samples to analyze until we start a round of QC samples? 
run_QC_after_n_specimens = 11 

[QC.names] 
# Describes the key names and descriptions of the QC samples used.
EC = "EC: External_Control_(matrix)"
PB = "PB: Paper_Blank"
PO = "PO: Pooled_specimens"

[QC.patterns]
# Defines the hierarchy and patterns of QC sample placement throughout the plate

# Hierarchy of Patterns:
    # Start/End Patterns: Highest priority. Specific patterns for the first (`start`) and last (`end`) wells of the plate.
    # Specific Round Patterns: Specific instructions for individual rounds (e.g., `round_3`), counting 
    # Repeat Pattern: Specifies a pattern (`repeat`) to be repeated a certain number of times.
    # Alternating Patterns: Defines alternating patterns (`then_alternating`) that provide a general structure.


# Pattern Examples:
    # `round_3 = ["EC", "PO", "PB"]`: Specific pattern for round 3.
    # `start = ["EC", "PB"]`: Pattern for the start of the plate.
    # `alternating = [["PB", "PO"], ["EC", "PO"]]`: Alternating patterns.
    # `end = ["PB"]: Pattern for the end of the plate.
    # `repeat = { pattern = ["EC", "PB"], times = 3 }`: Repeats the specified pattern 3 times.


round_3 = ["EC", "PO"]
# round_3 = ["EC", "PO", "PB"]
# round_7 = ["PO", "PO", "EC"]

start = ["EC", "PB"]
# alternating = [["EC", "PB"], ["EC", "PO"]]
end = ["PB", "PB", "PB"]

# repeat = { pattern = ["EC", "PB"], times = 3 }
